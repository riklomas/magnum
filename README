Magnum Website Starter Kit
-------------------------------------------

Version 1.0, July 2009, Marc Tobias Kunisch

The Magnum Website Starter Kit is not a framework. It is merely a bunch 
of files intended to be used to quickly kick off the frontend of a website 
project with best practices in mind.

The idea behind magnum is that at the beginning of a website there are 
always certain tasks that need to be done and files to be set up. Use 
magnum to put a basic file/html/css/js structure in place to start off from.

Magnum's file structure:

index.html
static/
	css/
		global.css
		scratch.css
	js/
		global.js
		jquery.js		


Doctype:

Magnum uses an html5 doctype

Javascript:

jQuery Framework Version 1.4.1 is included in magnum http://jquery.com/


Accessibility:

A basic jump navigation for accessibility has been added into the markup.

global.js puts basic WAI ARIA landmark roles in place for the key elements.
Landmark roles are generated with Javascript so HTML still validates in
validators that don't know ARIA yet.


scratch.css

Developers can use the scratch.css file to add things that they think should
be part of the starter kit. Once discussed with the team and agreed upon styles
can be moved into global.css

Version 1.1, December 2009, Marc Tobias Kunisch

Added modernizr.js and sample font embedding

modernizr:

"Modernizr uses feature detection to test the current browser against upcoming features like rgba(), border-radius, CSS Transitions and many more. These are currently being implemented across browsers and with Modernizr you can start using them right now, with an easy way to control the fallbacks for browsers that donâ€™t yet support them.

Additionally, Modernizr creates a self-titled global JavaScript object which contains properties for each feature; if a browser supports it, the property will evaluate true and if not, it will be false.

Lastly, Modernizr also adds support for styling HTML 5 elements. This allows you to use more semantic, forward-looking elements such as <section>, <header> and <dialog> without having to worry about them not working in Internet Explorer."

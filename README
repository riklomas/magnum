Magnum Website Starter Kit
-------------------------------------------
Version 1.0, July 2009, Marc Tobias Kunisch

The Magnum Website Starter Kit is not a framework. It is merely a bunch 
of files intended to be used to quickly kick off the frontend of a website 
project with best practices in mind.

The idea behind magnum is that at the beginning of a website there are 
always certain tasks that need to be done and files to be set up. Use 
magnum to put a basic file/html/css/js structure in place to start off from.

Magnum's file structure:

index.html
static/
	global.css
	scratch.css
js/
	global.js
	jquery.js


Doctype:

Magnum uses an html5 doctype

Javascript:

jQuery Framework Version 1.3.2 is included in magnum http://jquery.com/
In global.js a class name "js" is added to the body so javascript dependant
styles can be cascaded down to elements.


Accessibility:

A basic jump navgation for accessibility has been added into the markup.

global.js puts basic WAI ARIA landmark roles in place for the key elements.
Landmark roles are generated with Javascript so HTML still validates in
validators that don't know ARIA yet.



scratch.css

Developers can use the scratch.css file to add things that they think should
be part of the starter kit. Once discussed with the team and agreed upon styles
can be moved into global.css
